In-Built Functions -

Aggregate Functions -   -> The Function is applied to the whole Group,
                           but we can use a Condition(Corresponding to every Single Row in the GROUP) to determine whether to pass an expression(to be included in the result) or Not as an Argument to the Function
                           Expression  can be Column Expression or a Condition(on Every Single Row of the Group) that returns an Expression or Some Constant).
                           Selected Group.(e.g Condition - DISTINCT, CASE(returning 1 or 0) OR ANY NORMAL CONDITION ON ANY NUMBER OF COLUMNS that returns an EXPRESSION... )                   -------- IMPORTANT   ------------
