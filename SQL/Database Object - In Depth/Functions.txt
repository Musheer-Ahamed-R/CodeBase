In-Built Functions -
      ISNULL         -     -> If the Expression passed is NOT NULL, then the Expression value itself is Returned, else the second Argument is Returned.
                           Syntax :
                              ISNULL(Expression, replacementValue)
                           Compatibility :
                              SQLSever

      COALESCE      -     -> Evaluates the arguments in order and returns the current value of the first expression that initially does not evaluate to NULL.
                          -> The COALESCE expression is a syntactic shortcut for the CASE expression. That is, the code COALESCE(expression1,...n) is rewritten by the query optimizer as the following CASE expression:
                             CASE
                              WHEN (expression1 IS NOT NULL) THEN expression1
                              WHEN (expression2 IS NOT NULL) THEN expression2
                              ...
                              ELSE expressionN
                             END
                          Syntax :
                              COALESCE ( expression [ ,...n ] )
                          Compatibility :
                              SQLServer, PostgreSQL

Aggregate Functions -   -> The Function is applied to the whole Group,
                           but we can use a Condition(Corresponding to every Single Row in the GROUP) to determine whether to pass an expression(to be included in the result) or Not as an Argument to the Function
                           Expression  can be Column Expression or a Condition(on Every Single Row of the Group) that returns an Expression or Some Constant).
                           Selected Group.(e.g Condition - DISTINCT, CASE(returning 1 or 0) OR ANY NORMAL CONDITION ON ANY NUMBER OF COLUMNS that returns an EXPRESSION... )                   -------- IMPORTANT   ------------
