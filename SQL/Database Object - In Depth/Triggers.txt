DDL Triggers   -  -> DDL triggers fire in response to a variety of Data Definition Language (DDL) events. These events primarily correspond to Transact-SQL statements that start
                     with the keywords CREATE, ALTER, DROP, GRANT, DENY, REVOKE or UPDATE STATISTICS.
                  -> Use DDL triggers when you want to do the following:
                        -> Prevent certain changes to your database schema.
                        -> Have something occur in the database in response to a change in your database schema.
                        -> Record changes or events in the database schema.
