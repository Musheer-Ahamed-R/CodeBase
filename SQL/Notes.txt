Notes :

   -> The Databases, Schemas, Tables, Views, functions, Triggers, Stored Procedures are all Database Objects.

   -> We can query two tables in two different databases on the same SQL Server, Using the Fully Qualified name of the Table(i.e 'DatabaseName'.'SchemaName'.'TableName')

   -> To make sure that the correct Object is always used, regardless of the current Database setting, qualify the Object name with the database and schema.
   
   -> When using Aggregate Functions, the additional Attributes must be in a Group By Clause.

   -> SET SINGLE_USER on a Database makes sure that only the Current User is Using the Database.(Used along with the Command "With Rollback Immediate").

   -> Parenthesis, usually used with SubQuery, can also be used in other cases to increase the Precedence of an Expression or a Select Query(e.g UNION).
