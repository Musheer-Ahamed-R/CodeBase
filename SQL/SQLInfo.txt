Database Server -

      Database Server is a Software Application that Contains Databases, Schemas, Tables, Triggers, Views, Indexes, Stored Procedures, Functions etc..

Types of Database Management System(Server) :

      1 -> Flat File Database
            -> A Single large Table.

      2 -> Relational Database
            -> Hierarchical Database
                     -> Folder Structure, One to One Relationship(i.e Employee reporting to a Single Manager(Parent).
                     -> A Folder/File is related to a Single Folder.
            -> RDBMS (Relational DBMS)
                     -> One to Many Relationship(i.e Employee reporting to a Multiple Managers).
                     -> A Table can be related to any other Table in a Database.
                     -> e.g SQL Server, MySQL, Oracle
            -> ORDBMS (Object-Relational DBMS)
                     -> e.g Postgres
            -> NEWSQL
                     -> Provides the Same Scalable Performance of NoSQL System for OLTP(Online Transaction Processing), while maintaining the ACID
                        guarantees of a Traditional Database System.
                     -> e.g Clustrix, NuoDB, MemSQL, Elastic Database, VoltDB, Google Spanner.

      3 -> NoSQL Database (Lacks in ACID test)
            -> Key-Value Database
                     -> e.g Amazon DynamoDB, Oracle Berkeley Db, Redis
            -> Graph Database
                     -> e.g Neo4j, infiniteGraph, Sones
            -> Column Database
                     -> e.g HBASE, Riak, Cassandra
            -> Document Database
                     -> Nested form of Key-Value database(JSON Structured)
                     -> e.g CouchDB, MongoDB, Terrastore

Terms and Meanings :

Database          - A Database is the Main Container, it Contains the Data, Log files and all the Schemas within it.
                     -> Whenever a Database is created, two files are Generated,
                           -> MASTER Data File (MDF)(Contains Actual Data)
                           -> LOG Data File (LDF)(Transaction Log File - Used to recover the Database).



Schemas           - A Schema is like a Folder within a Database(namespace/package), and are mainly used to group logical Objects together, which leads to ease of
                  Setting Permission by Schema. (e.g HR Schema, Research Schema, Vendors Schema etc.., Now HR User can be made to access only HR Schema).

                  Syntax :
                           CREATE SCHEMA schemaname AUTHORIZATION username;                                                   // Postgres - Authorization username could be skipped

                           -> Its a Distinct namespace, that exists independently of the Database User who Created it (i.e It Could be Made accessible to Other Users). Its Ownership is Transferable.

                           -> Every Database has a Default Schema. If we Create a Table without a Schema, it will go inside the Default Schema of the Database.

                           -> We can only DROP a Schema if it is Empty(No Objects inside it). Otherwise, we should use the CASCADE Command.

Tables/Entity     - A Table is a  Collection of Data Elements organized in terms of Rows and Columns. It is a Convenient representation of a Relation.

Field/Attribute   - Fields are the Properties(Column names) of a Table/Entity.
                    Types of Attributes :

                        -> Simple Single Values Attribute (e.g Gender)
                        -> Simple Multi-Values Attribute (e.g Phone No)
                        -> Composite Single Values Attribute (e.g firstname_lastname)
                        -> Composite Multi-Values Attribute (e.g sibilingfirstname_sibilinglastname)
                        -> Derived Attribute  =>  Values that do not exist in the base tables, but are calculated from the values stored in the base tables(e.g Average Salary of Employees, age derived from DOB, etc..)

Record/Row/TUPLE  - A Single instance of a table that represents set of related data.

Column            - Set of Value(Instance) of a Particular Type(Filed).

Different Types of Keys in a Table -

         -> Super Key
                     -> A Single Attribute or a Combination of Attributes that is used to uniquely identify a record.
                     -> A table can have many super keys.
                     -> The Combination of Attributes need not be minimal. (i.e There can be a Combination of three attributes for a Super key, even if one or two is sufficient to uniquely identify a Record).

         -> Candidate Key
                     -> The Minimal Super Key or the Irreducible Super Key (i.e An SINGLE Attribute or a Combination of Attributes that identifies the record uniquely, but none of its subsets can identify the records uniquely).

         -> Unique Key
                     -> They have UNIUUE values in a Table, except for NULL Values.
                     -> It can take NULL values (Those NULL values could occur MULTIPLE TIMES. Thus, need not always be a Candidate Key)
                     -> There can one or more Unique Keys in a Table.
                     -> It is a Single Attribute

         -> Primary Key
                     -> A Candidate Key that is used by the Database Designer for unique identification of each Row in a Table.
                     -> A Primary Key can Consist of One or More Attributes of a Table
                     -> It Cannot take NULL values
                     -> There can only be one Primary Key
                     -> It can be a Combination of Attributes(e.g Composite Primary Key)

         -> Composite Key(Compound Key/Concatenated Key)
                     -> If we use Multiple Attributes to create a Primary Key, then that Primary Key is called ad Composite Key

         -> Alternate Key
                     -> Any Candidate Key that is not a Primary Key.

         -> Secondary Key
                     -> The Attribute that are not even the Super Key, but can still be used for Identification of Records(though NOT UNIQUE).

         -> Foreign Key
                     -> An Attribute or Combination of Attribute in one Base table that points to the Primary Key of Another table.
                     -> This is used to ensure Referential Integrity of the Data.(i.e Only values that are already Present in the Parent Table or NULL is allowed)

         -> Artificial Key
                     -> If no Obvious Stand alone Primary Key or Composite Key is available, then we simply create a new Attribute and assign a Unique Number to each Record.
                     -> This eventually becomes the Primary Key.

         -> Surrogate Key


         -> Partial Key


Constraints in SQL :

         -> Primary Key           - PRIMARY KEY(Col1, Col2, Col3);

         -> Unique                - Checks if the Value for the Column, is UNIQUE in the Table.
                                    UNIQUE (Col)

         -> Foreign Key           - FOREIGN KEY(Col111, Col222, Col333) REFERENCES PARENT_TABLE(Col1, Col2, Col3);

                                    CASCADING Referential Integrity - This allows the Database Server to define the Actions which should be taken when a user attempts to
                                                                    Delete/Update a key to which an existing Foreign key points.
                                                                    -> The CASCADING Referential Integrity is for the FOREIGN KEY of a Table(i.e) Not for the Entire Parent Table. Thus, it can
                                                                    only be applied when a Foreign key is Declared.
                                                                    Options -
                                                                        -> NO ACTION (Default, DELETE/UPDATE is ROLLED BACK)
                                                                        -> CASCADE (DELETE/UPDATE reflected everywhere the key is referenced as a Foreign Key)
                                                                        -> SET NULL
                                                                        -> SET DEFAULT

         -> Check                 - This is used to limit the Range of values, that can be entered for a Column.(NULL is Considered as a Valid Value if Passed).
                                    CHECK (Boolean_Expression)

         -> NOT NULL              - Checks if the Value to be Inserted for a Column is Not NULL
                                    NOT NULL

         -> DEFAULT               - The Value to be Set for the Column, if no Value is specified(NULL is Considered as a Value if Passed).
                                    DEFAULT Default_Value

         Note :
            -> We should be using the Keyword CONSTRAINT, if we want to name our Constraint. (e.g CONSTRAINT prim_key_attr PRIMARY KEY(id).
            -> CONSTRAINT name should be UNIQUE WITHIN a SCHEMA. It should not Collide with Table name either.

Additional Properties :

         Identity Column          -       -> If a Column is Marked as an Identity Column, we need not provide Value for that Column, for each Record we Insert into that Table.
                                          -> We can also explicitly give the value for the Identity Column. But, in case of SQL Server, We have to SET
                                             IDENTITY_INSERT to "ON"(Used in case of filling the Deleted Values).
                                          -> Thus, It could allow duplicate values.
                                          -> Same as AUTO_INCREMENT in MYSQL or SEQUENCE in PostgreSQL(SERIAL is implicitly Converted to a SEQUENCE in PostgreSQL).
                                          -> DBCC Command(Database Consistency Check) can be used to RESET the Identity Value(Start value).
                                          -> Last generated Identity value can be retrieved using Three Commands
                                                   SCOPE_IDENTITY()              ->    Same Session and Same Scope
                                                   @@Identity                    ->    Same Session, but Any Scope
                                                   IDENT_CURRENT(TableName)      ->    Any Session and Any Scope

                                                   Session  - A Connection with the Database Server.(A Tab in Terminal)
                                                   Scope    - A Single Action(Like Inset, Update, Delete etc..)


Important Keywords in SQL

         -> CREATE      -     -> We use CREATE Command to Create ALL Types of the Database Objects.
                              Syntax :
                                 CREATE Object_Type Name ...

         -> ALTER       -     -> If we Want to Alter Any Object which is already created using the CREATE Command.
                              -> If ONLY is specified before the Table Name, only that Table is altered, else the Table and all its descendant Tables (if any) are altered
                              Syntax :
                                 ALTER Object_Type [IF EXISTS, ONLY] Name Option
                                 Option - ADD/MODIFY/DROP/ALTER/RENAME/VALIDATE/DISABLE/ENABLE/CLUSTER/SET/RESET/INHERIT/NO INHERIT/OF/NOT OF/OWNER TO

         -> DROP        -     -> TO Drop any Object
                              -> We Cannot DROP an Object if it is Currently in use.
                              Syntax :
                                 DROP Object_Type Name

         -> SELECT      -    -> To Retrieve Column Values from a Table or a Combination of Two tables(JOIN).
                             -> Better to Specify all Column names, instead of just * for Performance reasons.
                             -> The Select_List is a series of Expressions separated by commas. Each expression defines a column in the result set.
                             -> The Select_List could also contain EXPRESSION, involving literals, Arithmetic Operators(COUNT(id) + SUM(Salary)), SubQuery etc..
                             -> It Always gives a Result Set, even that that can be a Single value.
                             -> The optional AS keyword can be used to change the name, or to assign a name if the expression has no name.

                             Syntax :
                                 SELECT select_list
                                 [ INTO new_table_name ]
                                 FROM table_list
                                 [ WHERE search_conditions ]
                                 [ GROUP BY group_by_list ]
                                 [ HAVING search_conditions ]
                                 [ ORDER BY order_list [ ASC | DESC ] ]

                             The Select_List can also contain the following keywords that control the final format of the result set :
                                 ALL         -     -> The ALL keyword can explicitly ask for all rows. However, there is no need to specify ALL because it is the default.

                                 DISTINCT    -     -> The DISTINCT keyword eliminates duplicate rows from the results of a SELECT statement.
                                                   -> It is same like GROUP BY Clause, except that we cannot use Aggregate Functions(Without any Tweak) with it.(i.e Just Removes duplicates).
                                                   -> DISTINCT = GROUP BY - AGGREGATE FUNCTIONS
                                                   -> Distinct on Multiple Columns means, the Values should be Distinct on all the Columns.(e.g, record -> ('mush', 'chn') is DISTNICT only with record -> ('mush', 'chn')).
                                                   -> For the DISTINCT keyword, null values are considered to be duplicates of each other, and only one NULL is returned in the results, regardless of how many NULL values are encountered.
                                                   -> DISTINCT Cannot be applied on Specific Columns of a Select Query.
                                                   Syntax :
                                                      DISTINCT Col1[, Col2, Col3 ...]

                                 TOP/LIMIT   -     -> We can use the TOP Clause to limit the number of rows that are returned in the Result Set.
                                                   -> If a SELECT statement that includes TOP also has an ORDER BY clause, the rows to be returned are selected from the ordered result set.

                                                      Note :
                                                         expression - is a numeric expression that specifies the number of rows to be returned;

                                                         WITH TIES  - All rows that contain the last value returned by the ORDER BY clause are returned, even if doing this exceeds the number specified by expression.


                                                   -> The items in the select list can include the following:
                                                            -> A simple Expression, such as: a reference to a function(Scalar), a variable, a constant, or a Column in a table or view.

                                This is because joins are symmetric, you can join table A to B in either order and get the same answer. The same is not true if a subquery is involved.

                                OUTER JOIN   -  -> Outer joins, return all rows from at least one of the tables (Left or Right)or views mentioned in the FROM clause, as long as those rows meet any WHERE or HAVING search conditions.

                                                   LEFT JOIN   -  -> All rows, Other than the Matches Rows, are retrieved from the Left table. For those Rows, the Value for Columns in the Right Table will be NULL.

                                                   RIGHT JOIN  -  -> All rows, Other than the Matches Rows, are retrieved from the Right table. For those Rows, the Value for Columns in the Left Table will be NULL.

                                                   FULL JOIN   -  -> All rows, Other than the Matches Rows, are retrieved from the Left and the Right table. For those Rows, the Value for Columns in the Other Table will be NULL.

                                CROSS JOIN   -  -> This return all rows from the left table. Each row from the left table is combined with all rows from the right table.(i.e If the
                                                   First Table has 17 Rows and Second table has 10 Rows, then the Resultant ResultSet will have 170 Rows).

                                                -> They don't have an ON Clause or a WHERE Clause. If where Clause is used, they behave like INNER JOIN.

                                SELF JOIN    -  -> A table can be joined to itself in a self-join. Use a self-join when you want to create a result set that joins records in a table with other records in the same table.
                                                -> This is Done using an INNER JOIN.
                                                -> The Not-Equal join (<>) is rarely used. Not-Equal joins make sense only when used with a self-join that too as a Second Condition.

                                                -> The FROM Clauses can contain multiple join specifications. This allows many tables to be joined for a single query.
                                                -> The Middle table of the join, can be called the Translation table or Intermediate table, because Table is an intermediate point of Connection between the other Tables involved in the Join.
                                                -> The Second or Joins after it use the ResultSet returned from their Previous Join.
                                                -> When there is more than one join operator in the same statement, either to join more than two tables or to join more than two pairs of columns,
                                                   the Join expressions can be connected with AND or with OR.
