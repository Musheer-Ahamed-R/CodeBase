Database Server -

      Database Server is a Software Application that Contains Databases, Schemas, Tables, Triggers, Views, Indexes, Stored Procedures, Functions etc..

Types of Database Management System(Server) :

      1 -> Flat File Database
            -> A Single large Table.

      2 -> Relational Database
            -> Hierarchical Database
                     -> Folder Structure, One to One Relationship(i.e Employee reporting to a Single Manager(Parent).
                     -> A Folder/File is related to a Single Folder.
            -> RDBMS (Relational DBMS)
                     -> One to Many Relationship(i.e Employee reporting to a Multiple Managers).
                     -> A Table can be related to any other Table in a Database.
                     -> e.g SQL Server, MySQL, Oracle
            -> ORDBMS (Object-Relational DBMS)
                     -> e.g Postgres
            -> NEWSQL
                     -> Provides the Same Scalable Performance of NoSQL System for OLTP(Online Transaction Processing), while maintaining the ACID
                        guarantees of a Traditional Database System.
                     -> e.g Clustrix, NuoDB, MemSQL, Elastic Database, VoltDB, Google Spanner.

      3 -> NoSQL Database (Lacks in ACID test)
            -> Key-Value Database
                     -> e.g Amazon DynamoDB, Oracle Berkeley Db, Redis
            -> Graph Database
                     -> e.g Neo4j, infiniteGraph, Sones
            -> Column Database
                     -> e.g HBASE, Riak, Cassandra
            -> Document Database
                     -> Nested form of Key-Value database(JSON Structured)
                     -> e.g CouchDB, MongoDB, Terrastore

Terms and Meanings :

Database          - A Database is the Main Container, it Contains the Data, Log files and all the Schemas within it.
                     -> Whenever a Database is created, two files are Generated,
                           -> MASTER Data File (MDF)(Contains Actual Data)
                           -> LOG Data File (LDF)(Transaction Log File - Used to recover the Database).



Schemas           - A Schema is like a Folder within a Database(namespace/package), and are mainly used to group logical Objects together, which leads to ease of
                  Setting Permission by Schema. (e.g HR Schema, Research Schema, Vendors Schema etc.., Now HR User can be made to access only HR Schema).

                  Syntax :
                           CREATE SCHEMA schemaname AUTHORIZATION username;                                                   // Postgres - Authorization username could be skipped

                           -> Its a Distinct namespace, that exists independently of the Database User who Created it (i.e It Could be Made accessible to Other Users). Its Ownership is Transferable.

                           -> Every Database has a Default Schema. If we Create a Table without a Schema, it will go inside the Default Schema of the Database.

                           -> We can only DROP a Schema if it is Empty(No Objects inside it). Otherwise, we should use the CASCADE Command.

Tables/Entity     - A Table is a  Collection of Data Elements organized in terms of Rows and Columns. It is a Convenient representation of a Relation.

Field/Attribute   - Fields are the Properties(Column names) of a Table/Entity.
                    Types of Attributes :

                        -> Simple Single Values Attribute (e.g Gender)
                        -> Simple Multi-Values Attribute (e.g Phone No)
                        -> Composite Single Values Attribute (e.g firstname_lastname)
                        -> Composite Multi-Values Attribute (e.g sibilingfirstname_sibilinglastname)
                        -> Derived Attribute  =>  Values that do not exist in the base tables, but are calculated from the values stored in the base tables(e.g Average Salary of Employees, age derived from DOB, etc..)

Record/Row/TUPLE  - A Single instance of a table that represents set of related data.

Column            - Set of Value(Instance) of a Particular Type(Filed).

Different Types of Keys in a Table -

         -> Super Key
                     -> A Single Attribute or a Combination of Attributes that is used to uniquely identify a record.
                     -> A table can have many super keys.
                     -> The Combination of Attributes need not be minimal. (i.e There can be a Combination of three attributes for a Super key, even if one or two is sufficient to uniquely identify a Record).

         -> Candidate Key
                     -> The Minimal Super Key or the Irreducible Super Key (i.e An SINGLE Attribute or a Combination of Attributes that identifies the record uniquely, but none of its subsets can identify the records uniquely).

         -> Unique Key
                     -> They have UNIUUE values in a Table, except for NULL Values.
                     -> It can take NULL values (Those NULL values could occur MULTIPLE TIMES. Thus, need not always be a Candidate Key)
                     -> There can one or more Unique Keys in a Table.
                     -> It is a Single Attribute

         -> Primary Key
                     -> A Candidate Key that is used by the Database Designer for unique identification of each Row in a Table.
                     -> A Primary Key can Consist of One or More Attributes of a Table
                     -> It Cannot take NULL values
                     -> There can only be one Primary Key
                     -> It can be a Combination of Attributes(e.g Composite Primary Key)

         -> Composite Key(Compound Key/Concatenated Key)
                     -> If we use Multiple Attributes to create a Primary Key, then that Primary Key is called ad Composite Key

         -> Alternate Key
                     -> Any Candidate Key that is not a Primary Key.

         -> Secondary Key
                     -> The Attribute that are not even the Super Key, but can still be used for Identification of Records(though NOT UNIQUE).

         -> Foreign Key
                     -> An Attribute or Combination of Attribute in one Base table that points to the Primary Key of Another table.
                     -> This is used to ensure Referential Integrity of the Data.(i.e Only values that are already Present in the Parent Table or NULL is allowed)

         -> Artificial Key
                     -> If no Obvious Stand alone Primary Key or Composite Key is available, then we simply create a new Attribute and assign a Unique Number to each Record.
                     -> This eventually becomes the Primary Key.

         -> Surrogate Key


         -> Partial Key


Constraints in SQL :

         -> Primary Key           - PRIMARY KEY(Col1, Col2, Col3);

         -> Unique                - Checks if the Value for the Column, is UNIQUE in the Table.
                                    UNIQUE (Col)

         -> Foreign Key           - FOREIGN KEY(Col111, Col222, Col333) REFERENCES PARENT_TABLE(Col1, Col2, Col3);

                                    CASCADING Referential Integrity - This allows the Database Server to define the Actions which should be taken when a user attempts to
                                                                    Delete/Update a key to which an existing Foreign key points.
                                                                    -> The CASCADING Referential Integrity is for the FOREIGN KEY of a Table(i.e) Not for the Entire Parent Table. Thus, it can
                                                                    only be applied when a Foreign key is Declared.
                                                                    Options -
                                                                        -> NO ACTION (Default, DELETE/UPDATE is ROLLED BACK)
                                                                        -> CASCADE (DELETE/UPDATE reflected everywhere the key is referenced as a Foreign Key)
                                                                        -> SET NULL
                                                                        -> SET DEFAULT

         -> Check                 - This is used to limit the Range of values, that can be entered for a Column.(NULL is Considered as a Valid Value if Passed).
                                    CHECK (Boolean_Expression)

         -> NOT NULL              - Checks if the Value to be Inserted for a Column is Not NULL
                                    NOT NULL

         -> DEFAULT               - The Value to be Set for the Column, if no Value is specified(NULL is Considered as a Value if Passed).
                                    DEFAULT Default_Value

         Note :
            -> We should be using the Keyword CONSTRAINT, if we want to name our Constraint. (e.g CONSTRAINT prim_key_attr PRIMARY KEY(id).
            -> CONSTRAINT name should be UNIQUE WITHIN a SCHEMA. It should not Collide with Table name either.

Additional Properties :

         Identity Column          -       -> If a Column is Marked as an Identity Column, we need not provide Value for that Column, for each Record we Insert into that Table.
                                          -> We can also explicitly give the value for the Identity Column. But, in case of SQL Server, We have to SET
                                             IDENTITY_INSERT to "ON"(Used in case of filling the Deleted Values).
                                          -> Thus, It could allow duplicate values.
                                          -> Same as AUTO_INCREMENT in MYSQL or SEQUENCE in PostgreSQL(SERIAL is implicitly Converted to a SEQUENCE in PostgreSQL).
                                          -> DBCC Command(Database Consistency Check) can be used to RESET the Identity Value(Start value).
                                          -> Last generated Identity value can be retrieved using Three Commands
                                                   SCOPE_IDENTITY()              ->    Same Session and Same Scope
                                                   @@Identity                    ->    Same Session, but Any Scope
                                                   IDENT_CURRENT(TableName)      ->    Any Session and Any Scope

                                                   Session  - A Connection with the Database Server.(A Tab in Terminal)
                                                   Scope    - A Single Action(Like Inset, Update, Delete etc..)


Important Keywords in SQL

         -> CREATE      -     -> We use CREATE Command to Create ALL Types of the Database Objects.
                              Syntax :
                                 CREATE Object_Type Name ...

         -> ALTER       -     -> If we Want to Alter Any Object which is already created using the CREATE Command.
                              -> If ONLY is specified before the Table Name, only that Table is altered, else the Table and all its descendant Tables (if any) are altered
                              Syntax :
                                 ALTER Object_Type [IF EXISTS, ONLY] Name Option
                                 Option - ADD/MODIFY/DROP/ALTER/RENAME/VALIDATE/DISABLE/ENABLE/CLUSTER/SET/RESET/INHERIT/NO INHERIT/OF/NOT OF/OWNER TO

         -> DROP        -     -> TO Drop any Object
                              -> We Cannot DROP an Object if it is Currently in use.
                              Syntax :
                                 DROP Object_Type Name

         -> SELECT      -    -> To Retrieve Column Values from a Table or a Combination of Two tables(JOIN).
                             -> Better to Specify all Column names, instead of just * for Performance reasons.
                             -> The Select_List is a series of Expressions separated by commas. Each expression defines a column in the result set.
                             -> The Select_List could also contain EXPRESSION, involving literals, Arithmetic Operators(COUNT(id) + SUM(Salary)), SubQuery etc..
                             -> It Always gives a Result Set, even that that can be a Single value.
                             -> The optional AS keyword can be used to change the name, or to assign a name if the expression has no name.

                             Syntax :
                                 SELECT select_list
                                 [ INTO new_table_name ]
                                 FROM table_list
                                 [ WHERE search_conditions ]
                                 [ GROUP BY group_by_list ]
                                 [ HAVING search_conditions ]
                                 [ ORDER BY order_list [ ASC | DESC ] ]

                             The Select_List can also contain the following keywords that control the final format of the result set :
                                 ALL         -     -> The ALL keyword can explicitly ask for all rows. However, there is no need to specify ALL because it is the default.

                                 DISTINCT    -     -> The DISTINCT keyword eliminates duplicate rows from the results of a SELECT statement or Duplicates in an Aggregate Function if passed as an argument to it.
                                                   -> It is same like GROUP BY Clause, except that we cannot use Aggregate Functions(Without any Tweak) with it.(i.e Just Removes duplicates).
                                                   -> DISTINCT = GROUP BY - AGGREGATE FUNCTIONS
                                                   -> Distinct on Multiple Columns means, the Values should be Distinct on all the Columns.(e.g, record -> ('mush', 'chn') is DISTNICT only with record -> ('mush', 'chn')).
                                                   -> For the DISTINCT keyword, null values are considered to be duplicates of each other, and only one NULL is returned in the results, regardless of how many NULL values are encountered.
                                                   -> DISTINCT Cannot be applied only on Specific Columns of a Select Query.
                                                   Syntax :
                                                      DISTINCT Col1[, Col2, Col3 ...]

                                 TOP/LIMIT   -     -> We can use the TOP Clause to limit the number of rows that are returned in the Result Set.
                                                   -> If a SELECT statement that includes TOP also has an ORDER BY clause, the rows to be returned are selected from the ordered result set.

                                                                     OR
                                                               LIMIT expression
                                                      Note :
                                                         expression - is a numeric expression that specifies the number of rows to be returned;

                                                         WITH TIES  - All rows that contain the last value returned by the ORDER BY clause are returned, even if doing this exceeds the number specified by expression.


                                                   -> The items in the select list can include the following:
                                                            -> A simple Expression, such as: a reference to a function(Scalar), a variable, a constant, or a Column in a table or view.

                                             Correlated Subqueries   -  -> Many queries can be evaluated by executing the subquery once and substituting the resulting value or values into the WHERE clause of the outer query.

                                                                           This means that the subquery is executed repeatedly, once for each row that might be selected by the outer query.

         -> FROM        -    -> Contains a (comma Separated list of the Tables and Views) and JOINS from which the Result set data is retrieved.
                             -> We can use the FROM clause to:
                                    -> List the tables and views containing the columns referenced in the select list and in the WHERE clause. The table or view names can be aliased using the AS clause.

                                    -> Views in the local instance of SQL Server. SQL Server internally resolves a View reference to references against the base tables that make up the view.
                                    -> Linked tables. These are tables in OLE DB data sources that can be accessed by SQL Server. This is referred to as a distributed query. OLE DB data sources can be accessed from SQL Server by linking them as a linked server,
                                       or by referencing the data source in an OPENROWSET or OPENQUERY function.
                             -> The FROM clause is also used on the DELETE and UPDATE statements to define the Tables that are modified.
                             -> It can also have APPLY, PIVOT and the UNPIVOT operators.
                                    APPLY  -   -> The APPLY operator allows you to invoke a TABLE-VALUED FUNCTION or a Correlated SubQuery for each row returned by an Outer Table expression of a query.
                                               -> We can join a Result(Table) from a FUNCTION with other Tables, but not by simple joins. It can only be done using an APPLY operator.
                                               -> Its Most Important use can be, when The sets(Two tables) are not self-sufficient.(i.e the query uses values from table1 to define the second set, NOT TO JOIN WITH IT)(e.g. A Column value in table1 determines the No of Column to be retrieved from the table2).
                                               -> CROSS APPLY works better on things that have no simple JOIN condition.
                                               -> The table-valued function acts as the Right input and the Outer table expression acts as the Left input. The right input is evaluated for each row from the left input and the rows produced are combined for the final output.
                                               -> The list of columns produced by the APPLY operator is the set of columns in the left input followed by the list of columns returned by the right input.
                                               -> You pass one of the columns from the outer table to the function and the TVF returns the MATCHING ROWS. You can also use APPLY to supply a value to "join" on a derived table.
                                               -> You can also use the same Cross Apply and Outer Apply with Derived tables joined to your main query, this means you can select from a View instead of a TV function (code reuse).

                                               There are two forms of APPLY :
                                                   -> CROSS APPLY    -     -> This returns only rows from the outer table that produce a result set from the TABLE-VALUED FUNCTION.
                                                                           -> CROSS APPLY is SIMILAR to, but in most cased not the same as an INNER JOIN.(i.e When calling a TVF the TVF is called/executed for each row in the outer table/left input)
                                                   -> OUTER APPLY    -     -> This returns both rows that produce a result set, and rows that do not, with NULL values in the columns produced by the TABLE-VALUED FUNCTION.

                                               Note :
                                                   -> Calling TVF in an Inner Join Might be possible as long as we pass a Variable or a Constant.(i.e don't pass a Column value from first table to it.)
                                                   -> Subqueries or Table functions appearing in FROM can be preceded by the key word LATERAL. This allows them to reference columns provided by preceding FROM items.(Co-related SubQuery)
                                                   -> PostgreSQL Equivalent of CROSS APPLY and OUTER APPLY are INNER JOIN LATERAL and LEFT JOIN LATERAL respectively.

                                             A wildcard in or at the end of an expression does not preclude use of an index.

                                    Exists          -  -> When a subquery is introduced with the keyword EXISTS, the subquery functions as an existence test.(i.e The subquery
                                                          does not actually produce any data, it returns a value of TRUE or FALSE.
                                                       -> The WHERE clause of the outer query tests whether the rows that are returned by the subquery exist.
                                                       -> The Subquery is a CORRELATED SubQuery.(i.e It references a Table Outside the SubQuery)
                                                       -> JOIN along with DISTINCT does the same thing, but EXISTS has a Performance Advantage Over Join(i.e It returns True if there exists at least a Single Record, need not go through all the records, Unlike JOIN).
                                                       -> Logically very Similar to the IN Clause, but we don't use JOIN Like Condition in the SubQuery.
                                                       -> The keyword EXISTS is not preceded by a column name, constant, or other expression.
                                                       -> The select list of a subquery introduced by EXISTS almost always consists of an asterisk (*).
                                                          There is no reason to list column names because you are just testing whether rows that meet the conditions specified in the subquery exist.

                                    IN              -  -> The Possible Values for IN WITH A SUBQUERY is, all the Values for the related Column in the other table. It is as Efficient as Exists(Discussed above).
                                                       -> The SubQuery can have only one Column

                                                       -> >ALL, means greater than the Maximum value and >ANY means greater than the Minimum value in the List returned by the SubQuery.
                                                       -> =ANY is Equivalent to IN and <>ALL is same as NOT IN.

                                 Using NULL VALUES  -  -> A value of NULL indicates that the value is UNKNOWN. A value of NULL is different from an empty or zero value.
                                                       -> No two null values are equal. Comparisons between two null values, or between a NULL and any other value, return UNKNOWN because the value of each NULL is UNKNOWN.
                                                       -> Null values generally indicate data that is UNKNOWN, not applicable, or that the data will be added later.
                                                         Following is information about nulls:
                                                            -> To test for null values in a query, use IS NULL or IS NOT NULL in the WHERE clause.
                                                            -> When query results are viewed in SQL Server Management Studio Code editor, null values are shown as NULL in the result set.
                                                            -> Null values can be inserted into a column by explicitly stating NULL in an INSERT or UPDATE statement, by leaving a column out of an INSERT statement, or
                                                               when adding a new column to an existing table by using the ALTER TABLE statement.
                                                            -> Null values cannot be used for information that is required to distinguish one row in a table from another row in a table, such as primary keys.

                                 Order Of Execution -  -> Understanding the correct sequence in which the WHERE, GROUP BY, and HAVING clauses are applied helps in CODING EFFICIENT QUERIES :
                                                            -> The WHERE clause is used to filter the rows that result from the operations specified in the FROM clause.
                                                            -> The GROUP BY clause is used to group the output of the WHERE clause.
                                                            -> The HAVING clause is used to filter rows from the grouped result.
                                 Operator Preced    -  -> When more than one logical operator is used in a statement, NOT is evaluated first, then AND, and finally OR. Arithmetic, and bitwise, operators are handled before logical operators.

                                Note :

                                    -> IN, ANY, ALL, EXISTS can be used with a SubQuery.
                                    -> EXISTS is better than JOIN + DISTINCT
                                    -> When you search for a Unicode string in a WHERE clause, put the N character before the search string.

         -> DELETE

         -> JOIN        -    -> By using joins, we can retrieve data from two or more tables(or VIEWS or a SubQuery) based on logical relationships between the tables.
                             -> JOIN takes all the record, when a Col in One table has Multiple matches in Other table(Col is Duplicated as many times it found a Match on the Other table).
                             -> A join can always be expressed as a subquery. A subquery can often, but not always, be expressed as a join.
                                This is because joins are symmetric, you can join table A to B in either order and get the same answer. The same is not true if a subquery is involved.
                                Syntax :

                             -> A join condition defines the way two tables are related in a query by:
                                      -> Specifying the column from each table to be used for the join. A typical join condition specifies a foreign key from one table and its associated key in the other table.
                                      -> Specifying a logical operator (for example, = or <>,) to be used in comparing values from the columns.
                             -> Inner joins can be specified in either the FROM (Includes ON Clause)or WHERE clauses. Outer joins can be specified in the FROM clause only.
                             -> Specifying the Join conditions in the FROM clause helps separate them from any other search conditions that may be specified in a WHERE clause, and is the recommended method for specifying joins.
                             -> Columns used in a join condition are not required to have the same name or be the same data type. However, if the data types are not identical,
                                they must be compatible, or be types that SQL Server can implicitly convert. If the data types cannot be implicitly converted, the join condition must explicitly convert the data type using the CAST function.
                             -> When there are NULL values in the columns of the tables being joined, the NULL values do not match each other. The presence of NULL values in a column(JOIN Column) from one of the tables
                                being joined can be returned only by using an outer join (unless the WHERE clause excludes null values).
                             -> The JOIN Columns need not be having a Primary Key and a Foreign Key Relationship, even though it should be having for performance reasons.

                                                -> The Not-Equal join (<>) is rarely used. As a general rule, Not-Equal joins make sense only when used with a self-join.
                                                -> This is the Default Join.(i.e its an Inner Join if only Join is specified).
                                                Types of Inner Join  -
                                                      -> A THETA join allows for arbitrary comparison relationships (such as ≥).
                                                      -> An EQUI-JOIN is a theta join using the equality operator.
                                                      -> A NATURAL join is an EQUI-JOIN on attributes that have the same NAME in each relationship. Additionally, a natural join removes the duplicate columns involved in
                                                         the equality comparison. This type of JOIN is HIGHLY DISCOURAGED.


                                OUTER JOIN   -  -> Outer joins, return all rows from at least one of the tables (Left or Right)or views mentioned in the FROM clause, as long as those rows meet any WHERE or HAVING search conditions.
                                                -> To get Only the Non-Matching Rows Over an Outer Join, in addition to the Normal Join Condition in the ON Clause, we have to use an Additional NULL Check on the JOIN COLUMN of the Other table in the Where Clause.
