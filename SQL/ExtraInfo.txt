Sparse Columns -  -> Sparse columns are ordinary columns that have an optimized storage for null values.
                  -> Sparse columns reduce the space requirements for null values at the cost of more overhead to retrieve non-null values.
                  -> Consider using sparse columns when the space saved is at least 20 percent to 40 percent.
                  -> Because sparse columns have many null-valued rows, they are especially appropriate for filtered indexes.
                  Syntax :
                     CREATE TABLE Table_Name( Col1 Type SPARSE NULL, ... )
