   SEQUENCE          -  It is a database object, not a data type. Simple object, that
                        can be used to generate unique integer numbers for Columns WITHIN the Schema.

   SERIAL            -  It is a fictive/pseudo datatype. It implicitly creates its own SEQUENCE object(table_col_seq) and can create a reference on this object.
                        The implicitly generated Sequence can be used in other Tables WITHIN the schema. But, if the parent Table(where it is implicitly created)
                        is deleted, then insertion into other dependent table gives NULL or an error(If NULL is Not allowed).

   Note :

      -> RETURNING COL, can also be used to get the inserted Column value, of an INSERT Statement.
      -> To get last generated id of a Specific Sequence in a Single SESSION, SELECT currval('name_of_your_sequence');
      -> To get the last value from the last sequence used in a Single SESSION, SELECT lastval();
