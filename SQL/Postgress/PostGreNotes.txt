   SEQUENCE          -  It is a database object, not a data type. Simple object, that
                        can be used to generate unique integer numbers for Columns across the Schema.

   SERIAL            -  It is a fictive/pseudo datatype. It implicitly creates its own SEQUENCE object(table_col_seq) and
                        can create a reference on this object. The implicitly generated Sequence can be used in other Tables across the schema.
                        But, if the parent Table(where it is implicitly created) is deleted, then insertion into other dependent table gives an error.
