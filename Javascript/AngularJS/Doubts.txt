5 ->  List out all the values tracked inside of the controller scope object(e.g like attribute values etc..)
6 ->  require in components
7 ->  ng-bind - Using require, $onInit, $postLink, $onDestroy Video - .45 - 1. min
8 ->  What is object structure of the object that gets passed to the $onChanges

9 ->  Check if below is true or false. I think that field is automatically created by angular and can be accessed inside of the controller.
      The field "myField" need not exist inside of the controller. In which case it will be a template only variable. 
10->  Is there no difference between dynamic values in url and query params. i.e /user/id AND /user?id=1
      I think they both are SAME (/contact/:id OR /contact?id). The only difference will be URL
