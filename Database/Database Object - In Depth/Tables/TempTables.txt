Temporary Tables  -  -> Temporary Tables are very Similar to the Permanent Tables. Permanent Tables get created in the Database
                        we Specify and remain in the Database Permanently, until we Drop Them. Whereas, Temporary Tables
                        get Created in the TempDB and are AUTOMATICALLY DELETED, when they are No Longer Used.

Types             -  -> Local Temporary Tables
                     -> Global Temporary Tables

                     Local Temporary Tables -   -> The Local Temporary Table is available only for the Connection that has Created the Table.
                                                -> This is Automatically Dropped when the Connection that has Created it is Closed.
                                                -> If the Temporary Table is Created inside the Stored Procedure, it gets DROPPED Automatically
                                                   upon the Completion of the Stored procedure Execution.
                                                -> It is also possible for Different Connections to Create a LOCAL Temporary Table with the Same Name.

                     Global Temporary Tables -  -> Global Temporary Tables are Visible to all the Connections of the Sql Server and are Only Destroyed
                                                   When the Last Connection Referencing the Table is Closed.
                                                -> Global Temporary Tables has to be Unique Across User User Connections.


Creation          -  -> We use the Same Syntax for the Creation of Temporary Tables, except that we prefix the name of that Table
                        With a #(Local TT) or ##(Global TT).
