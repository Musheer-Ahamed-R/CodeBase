Types of Triggers    -  -> DML Triggers
                        -> DDL Triggers
                        -> LOGON Triggers

DML Triggers         -  -> DML triggers is a special type of STORED PROCEDURES that automatically takes effect when a data manipulation language (DML) event takes place that affects
                           the table or view defined in the trigger.
                        -> DML events include INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statements.
                        -> DML triggers can be used to enforce business rules and data integrity, query other tables, and include complex Transact-SQL statements.
                        -> The trigger and the statement that fires it are treated as a single transaction, which can be rolled back from within the trigger.
                        -> If a severe error is detected (for example, insufficient disk space), the entire transaction automatically rolls back.

DML Trigger Benefits -  -> 

Types of DML Triggers-  -> AFTER trigger  -  -> AFTER triggers are executed after the action of the INSERT, UPDATE, MERGE, or DELETE statement is performed.
                                             -> AFTER triggers are never executed if a constraint violation occurs. Therefore, these triggers cannot be used for any processing that might prevent constraint violations.
                                             -> For every INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE action specified in a MERGE statement, the corresponding trigger is fired for each DML operation.

                           INSTEAD OF trigger-> INSTEAD OF triggers override the standard actions of the triggering statement.
                                             -> Therefore, they can be used to perform error or value checking on one or more columns and the perform additional actions before insert, updating or deleting the row or rows.




DDL Triggers   -  -> DDL triggers fire in response to a variety of Data Definition Language (DDL) events. These events primarily correspond to Transact-SQL statements that start
                     with the keywords CREATE, ALTER, DROP, GRANT, DENY, REVOKE or UPDATE STATISTICS.
                  -> Use DDL triggers when you want to do the following:
                        -> Prevent certain changes to your database schema.
                        -> Have something occur in the database in response to a change in your database schema.
                        -> Record changes or events in the database schema.
