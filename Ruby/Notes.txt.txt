1 -> No type for variables(not even let)


Printing:
   -> puts "" OR puts [1, 2, 3]     // returns null i.e just printing but also iterates if iteratable
   -> p "" OR p [1, 2, 3]           // Here p prints and returns the value

Getting value:
   -> gets 
   -> gets.chomp()                  // truncates the \n character in the end


Variables:
   -> Local Variables

   -> Global variables
         -> put $ infront of the variable (e.g $x)
         -> Highly not recommended to use it as it will pollute the code and cause unnecessary naming issues.

   -> Instance variables
         -> put @ infront of the variable (e.g @y)
         -> Used to share data across components like from method to a view etc..

   -> Constant
         -> All caps. Also, its value can be changed.

   -> Class variable
         -> put @@y infront of the variable (e.g @@z)
         -> Varibale only available to that class instance.
