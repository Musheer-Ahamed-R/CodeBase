Dynamic contents:
  ->  <% provide(:title, "Home") %>   //  <% - to run ruby code inside.
  ->  <%= yield(:title) %>            //  <%= yield - To yield a value.

Tests:
->  test "should get about" do
      get static_pages_about_url
      assert_response :success
    end
    what is static_pages_about_url and root_url (for root) in above ?
->  assert_response
->  assert_select


Update the layout links to use the helf route from Listing 5.29.
