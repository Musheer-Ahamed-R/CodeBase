->  understand routes.rb file
->  validates :content, length: { maximum: 140 }
->  has_many :microposts
->  belongs_to :user
->  layout

->  Diff between get 'static_pages/about' and root 'application#hello' (i.e why is # and / used interchangeably ??)


Dynamic contents:
  ->  <% provide(:title, "Home") %>   //  <% - to run ruby code inside.
  ->  <%= yield(:title) %>            //  <%= yield - To yield a value.

Tests:
->  test "should get about" do
      get static_pages_about_url
      assert_response :success
    end
    what is static_pages_about_url and root_url (for root) in above ?
->  assert_response
->  assert_select

what is Active Record ??
