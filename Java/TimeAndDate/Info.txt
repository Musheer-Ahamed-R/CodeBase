Locale	-	-> A Locale object represents a specific geographical, political, or cultural region. An operation that requires a Locale to perform its task 				 is called locale-sensitive and uses the Locale to tailor information for the user. For example, displaying a number is a locale-sensitive 
			   operation— the number should be formatted according to the customs and conventions of the user's native country, region, or culture.

			-> So, Local… means “NOT ZONED”. It cannot represent an instant on the time-line without additional information such as an offset or time-zone.   

			-> A Locale object logically consists of the fields described below.

			   		-> Language
			   		-> Script
			   		-> Country (region)
			   		-> Variant
			   		-> Extensions
			   		-> Unicode locale/language extension


TimeZone	-> A time zone is a region of the globe that observes a "Uniform Standard Time" for legal, commercial, and social purposes. Time zones tend 
			   to follow the boundaries of countries and their subdivisions because it is convenient for areas in close commercial or other communication 
			   to keep the same time.

			-> Most of the time zones on land are offset from Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) by a whole number of hours (UTC−12 to UTC+14), but a few 
			   zones are offset by 30 or 45 minutes (for example Newfoundland Standard Time is UTC−03:30, Nepal Standard Time is UTC+05:45, and Indian 
			   Standard Time is UTC+05:30). Some higher latitude and temperate zone countries use daylight saving time for part of the year, typically by 
			   adjusting local clock time by an hour. Many land time zones are skewed toward the west of the corresponding nautical time zones. This also 
			   creates a permanent daylight saving time effect.
