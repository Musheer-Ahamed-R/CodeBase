Factory Pattern(Creational) : 

	-> In this, we create object without exposing the creation logic 
	   to client and the client use the same common interface to create new type
	   of object.
	-> The idea is to use a static member-function (static factory method) which
	   creates & returns instances, hiding the details of class modules from user.


	Notes : 
		-> This pattern is followed especially when the Object(we want to create) 
		   is part of Polymorpism.(creation object based on the parameter).
		-> A factory pattern is one of the core design principles to create an 
		   object, allowing clients to create objects of a library in a way such 
		   that it doesnâ€™t have tight coupling with the
		   class hierarchy of the library.(i.e Class creation(factory) is also
		   DONE AT THE LIBRARY SIDE).
