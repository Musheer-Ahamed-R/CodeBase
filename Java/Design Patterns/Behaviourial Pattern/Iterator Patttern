Iterator Pattern : 

	-> The iterator pattern provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate
	   object without exposing its underlying representation(i.e Array, List or Set).
	-> There are a lot of data structures/collections available in every language. 
	   Each collection must provide an iterator that lets it iterate through its
	   objects. However while doing so it should make sure that it does not expose
	   its implementation.
	-> Thus, if we would have used some other DataStructure instead of current one in
	   future, there will not be any change in the client code due to the decoupling 
	   achieved by the use of iterator interface.
