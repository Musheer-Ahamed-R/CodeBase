public class Islands {

    // Find the number of islands

    // Can be solved using a simple DFS approach
    // The problem can be easily solved by applying DFS() on each component. 
    // We will call DFS on the next un-visited component. The number of calls to DFS() gives the number of
    // connected components. BFS can also be used.

    // IMPORTANT
    // The array here is not a mapping/edges as in normal cases. Each CELL here is a seperate node
    // and we could(if true) traverse to 8 positions from that node
