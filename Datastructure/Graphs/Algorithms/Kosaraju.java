public class Kosaraju {
	
	// Topological sort
	// Create a new graph which is reversed
	// Pop elements from stack and do DFS(UNVISITED nodes)

	// See Tushar roy video for logic/intution behind this.
	// i.e By reversing we are restricting/reversing the movement from the current SCC to another SCC
	// and since the first SCC is first in stack it traverses all SCC before we move on to second SCC.

	// Note: 
	// -> This is only for directed graphs
