1 -> A Graph is a Pair(V, E), where V is a set of nodes, called Vertices and E is a collection of Vertices, called Edges.

2 -> Two types of Graphs

         -> Directed Graph(All the Edges are directed)(e.g route network)
         -> UnDirected Graph(All the Edges are undirected(e.g flight network)

3 -> When an Edge connects two Vertices, the Vertices are said to ADJACENT to each other.

4 -> Graphs can be represented in Three ways

         -> Adjacency Matrix
         -> Adjacency List
         -> Adjacency Set
