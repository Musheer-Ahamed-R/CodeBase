1 -> FORGET Doing problems in Graphs with knowing/considering Cycle Cases.(Both Directed and Un-Directed).

2 -> In case of BFS, we should mark the node as visited when adding the node to the Queue itself.

3 -> Having the visitied node information inside of the node iteslf is not very elegant. We may keep it in a seperate visitied array
		 or have a wrapper over graph vertex.

4 -> Detecting Cycle in an undirected graph can be done using both BFS and DFS. But in case of Directed graph, only DFS can be used.

5 -> Always consider using Stack if we need to track path while we traverse.
