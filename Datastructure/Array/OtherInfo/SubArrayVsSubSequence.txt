SubArray 		- A SubbArray is a Contiguous part of array. An array that is inside another array. For example, consider the array [1, 2, 3, 4], There are 10 non-empty sub-arrays. 
				  The subbarays are (1), (2), (3), (4), (1,2), (2,3), (3,4), (1,2,3), (2,3,4) and (1,2,3,4). In general, for an array/string of size n, there are n*(n+1)/2 non-empty SubArrays/SubStrings.

SubSequence		- A SubSequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by zero or more elements, Without changing the Order of the remaining elements.
				  For the same example, there are 15 sub-sequences. They are (1), (2), (3), (4), (1,2), (1,3),(1,4), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (1,2,3), (1,2,4), (1,3,4), (2,3,4), (1,2,3,4). More generally, we can say that for a sequence of size n, we can have (2n-1) non-empty sub-sequences in total.
