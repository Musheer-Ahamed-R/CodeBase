1 -> NEVER EVER USE a value as a loop continuation condition whose value could CHANGE during ITERATION, Unless we explicitly want that behaviour.(e.g list size)

2 -> Keep the CONDITION(if condition or loop continuation condition) as simple as possible. HUGELY reduces occurrence of bugs.

3 -> HashTable(Array) can be used to check the Presence and also useful for many manipulations(Count occurrence) of an Element in an Array. But, the
     Drawback is that we should know the MAX Range of Elements.(THUS NOT PREFERRED)

4 -> We can use a HashMap instead of a HashTable(Array) for checking occurrences or counting occurrences.

5 -> Binary Search SHOULD be ALWAYS in MIND when working with Arrays When the Array Elements are in SOME ORDER (e.g Sorted Order, Increasing then Decreasing,
     Order Maintained between Arrays etc..) and we need to FIND/SEARCH for an Element or a Change in the Order in such an Array.
     Note :
         -> Binary Search can also be used in Array which DO NOT FOLLOW ANY ORDER. We just need to set the Condition Properly.(Condition to go Left or Right)
            (e.g Find the Peak Element.)

6 -> If the RANGE of Elements are KNOWN(), then the Array Index can be useful(Counting Sort) in many ways.( e.g finding Element Occurrences,
     occurrence count etc..). In this case, the INDEX OF SAME ARRAY ITSELF can ALSO be used.(e.g Finding Duplicate Elements).

7 -> Try XOR if Array has DUPLICATE/REPEATING Values. This approach can be used to Find SINGLE UNIQUE Element or DOUBLE UNIQUE and also DUBLE DUPLICATE Elements.
        -> XOR is both Commutative and ASSOCIATIVE
        -> XOR of a number with itself is 0.
        -> XOR with a Number and 0 returns the Number itself

8 -> Try SUM of Numbers and then Manipulating (like finding DIFF between two SUM etc..)

9 -> Sorting/Using Two Loops can save our day SOMETIMES.
