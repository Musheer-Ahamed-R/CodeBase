1 -> NEVER EVER USE a value as a loop continuation condition whose value could CHANGE during ITERATION, Unless we explicitly want that behaviour.(e.g list size)

2 -> Keep the CONDITION(if condition or loop continuation condition) as simple as possible. HUGELY reduces occurrence of bugs.

3 -> HashTable can be used to check the Presence and also useful for many manipulations(Count occurrence) of an Element in an Array. But, the
     Drawback is that we should know the MAX Range of Elements.
