               1 ->           Binary Tree                                Each Node cannot have more than two Children

               2 ->           Generic Tree(N-ary Tree)                   Each Node can have any number of Children

               3 ->           Threaded Binary Tree                       Binary Tree where a Node's Left Child points to its InOrder Predecessor or
                                                                         a Node's Right Child points to its InOrder Successor, or Both. It Only points to
                                                                         its Successor or Predecessor if it was Originally pointing to NULL.

               4 ->           Expression Tree                            All Leaf Nodes are Operands and all Other Nodes are Operators.

               5 ->           XOR Tree                                   Each Node has an XOR of its Parent and LeftChild and an XOR of its Parent and Right Child

               5 ->           Binary Search Tree                         All the Nodes in the Left Subtree of the Node(Root) should be less than the Node data and
                                                                         All the Nodes in the Right Subtree of the Node(Root) should be greater than the Node data.

               6 ->           AVL(Adelson-Velskii and Landis) Tree       Its is self-balancing BST, but the Difference between the Height of a Node's Left SubTree and
                                                                         its Right SubTree must not be greater than 1.

               7 ->           Red-Black Tree                             It is also a self-balancing BST, with each Node having a Color property(some restrictions on them).

               8 ->           Splay Tree

               9 ->           B-Tree

              10 ->           Augmented Tree

              11 ->           Scapegoat Tree

              12 ->           Interval Tree
