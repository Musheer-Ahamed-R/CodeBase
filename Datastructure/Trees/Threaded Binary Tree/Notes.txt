Threaded Binary Tree -

    - A Binary tree is Threaded by making all Right child pointers that would NORMALLY be NULL, point to the InOrder-Successor of the node (if it exists),
and all LEFT child pointers that would NORMALLY be NULL point to the InOrder-Predecessor of the node.

Types :
    Single Threaded: each node is threaded towards either the in-order predecessor(Left) or successor(Right).
    Double threaded: each node is threaded towards both the in-order predecessor(Left) and successor(Right).
    Here, Left Node will always point to a Predecessor and Right Node will always point to Successor.

    - A Node inside a Node(Main Node) is a Thread if it points to either the in-order predecessor(Left) or the in-order successor(Right).

    - When we hear the word Predecessor or Successor of a Particular Node for a Specific Traversal, first write the Complete Traversal,
      then visualize the Predecessor or Successor from that.
