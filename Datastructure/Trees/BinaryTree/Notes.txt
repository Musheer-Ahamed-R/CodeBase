Important Points

1 -> Don't use root.getLChild() or root.getRChild() for NULL check(unless entirely necessary). It causes a lot of trouble with null pointer exception

2 -> The Order in which Left and the Right Child are added is extremely important(e.g, Iterative PreOrderTraversal, tree to doubly linked list)

3 -> Traversal Findings
          PreOrder Traversal :
                1 -> 1 -> A Node will always have its left child after it.

          InOrder Traversal :
                1 -> flattens the Tree.(used in converting Tree to a Linked List)
                2 -> gives Nodes in increasing order if the tree is a BinarySearch Tree
                3 -> for a particular node, its left and right children are on its left and right respectively.(used in constructing a tree, if another traversal is given)

          PostOrder Traversal
                1 -> A Node will always have its right child before it.(used in case of Iterative Traversal)


4 -> The return value(Base Case) in a recursive call has a MAJOR MAJOR impact in the problem solution.(i.e They should be used wisely)
