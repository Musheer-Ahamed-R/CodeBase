1 -> Finding if a Tree is a BST or not can also be solved by inorder Traversal by just keeping a reference to
     previous variable.

2 -> In Converting a Binary tree to BST, the sorted array should replace the B Tree in INORDER TRAVERSAL.

3 -> In Converting a BST to Min-Heap, the sorted array should replace the BST in PREORDER TRAVERSAL.

4 -> The Lowest Common Ancestor in BST is the Point at which the the two nodes split.

5 -> Convert a sorted LL/DLL to a Balanced BST(method involving bottom up approach, using just mid/2 and so on)

6 -> Check if given Array is Preorder Traversal of a Binary Serach Tree(Using Manipulated version of next greater element)
