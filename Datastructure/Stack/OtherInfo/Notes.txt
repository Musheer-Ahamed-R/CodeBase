Notes :

1 -> Use Stack if Balancing Paranthesis or Infix to Postfix or Evaluation of Expression(PreFix or PostFix) is asked.
	 Also(in case of balanced paranthesis), The last Open Paranthesis is the One that will be get Closed First(Matches the Policy of Stack)..

**2 -> Consider Using Stack if the Problem Involves BACKTRACKING(Including Tree Traversals).

3 -> Use STACK if the Current Element depends on other Elements in the Array (e.g Previous or Next Elements).

4 -> In case of Stack, the Problem should always be Considered "STEP BY STEP". (Just like Recursion). Otherwise, we "COULD NOT POSSIBLY SOLVE" the Problem.

5 -> Popping from one stack and pushing that into another stack actually Reverses the Stack Elements.(Speciality of Stack)
