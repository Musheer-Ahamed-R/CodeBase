Stack Info	-	-> There are two ways to implement a stack:
						-> Using array
							  Pros: Easy to implement. Memory is saved as pointers are not involved.
							  Cons: It is not dynamic. It doesnâ€™t grow and shrink depending on needs at runtime.(This can be Overcome using ArrayList).
						-> Using linked list		
							  Pros: The linked list implementation of stack can grow and shrink according to the needs at runtime.
							  Cons: Requires extra memory due to involvement of pointers.

Applications	-
				-> Balancing of symbols
				-> Infix to Postfix /Prefix conversion
				-> Redo-undo features at many places like editors, photoshop.
				-> Forward and backward feature in web browsers
				-> Used in many algorithms like Tower of Hanoi, tree traversals, stock span problem, histogram problem.
				-> Other applications can be Backtracking, Knight tour problem, rat in a maze, N queen problem and sudoku solver.
