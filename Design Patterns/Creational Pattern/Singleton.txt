Singleton Pattern : 
	
	-> The singleton pattern is a design pattern that restricts the instantiation of
	   a class to one object.

	Implementations :
	
		-> Eager Initialization(public static variable)
		-> Lazy Instantaniation(private static variable and public method)
			-> synchronized method
			-> synchronized method inside null check
			-> double check synchronized block   
		-> Bill Pugh Singleton Implementation	

	e.g Used in database connections, caching, Configuration File, thread pool, logging, driver objects		
	
	Notes : 
		-> java.lang.Runtime is Singleton in nature.
		-> Since every variable points to a single instance, it can create problems
		   if the Instance itself is MUTABLE.

	Things that break Singleton Pattern :
	
		-> Reflection(Use Enums)
		-> Serialization and De-Serialization(override readResolve method)
		-> Cloning(override clone and stop default cloning)
