Pattern Matching  -
   Given a String Text and a Pattern, Find the All the Positions in the Text, where the Pattern Appears as a Sub-String.

   -> Exact Pattern Matching  -  -> Where Does the Read(Pattern) match the Reference Genome(Text String) Exactly.

   -> Approximate Pattern     -  -> Where Does the Read(Pattern) match the Reference Genome(Text String) Approximately.
      Matching                      Here, an Integer will be Given which Decide the ATMOST Number of Mis-Matches.

   -> Multiple Pattern        -  -> Where do Billions of Reads Match in the Reference Genome.??
