public class BucketSort {

   // Algorithm -> This sort works if the array elements are within a range.
   //           -> This gets this name because we are sorting the elements(using Insertion Sort) inside the Bucket.
   //    Steps :
   //         -> We will write a hash function that will decide in which Bucket the element will go.
   //         -> Then we sort the elements in each Bucket using Insertion Sort.
   //         -> The we will take elements from each Bucket(in the same order) and insert it back into the Array.
