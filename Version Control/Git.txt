SSH Keys : 

    -> 


remote : 

    -> Using this we can tell our repository(machine) about the remote urls we want it to know/connect to.
    -> We can have more than one remote in our repository.(This is where the remote name comes into play)
       One of the remote(origin) will be the GitHub itself.
    -> Thus, the local repository can NOT ONLY be pushed to GitHub, but also to other remote applications that we specify.


    git remote add <alias> <url>        // This creates a new remote with that alias name, that points to given url
    git remote                          // Tell us about all the remotes that our repository(in our machine) knows about
    git remote rm <alias>

Ignore files : 

    -> We can ignore specific files/folder by specifying them in .gitignore file and pushing .gitignore file to git repository.    
     e.g *.class will ignore all the files with .class extension in our local repository
