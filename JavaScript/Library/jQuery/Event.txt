Events               -  -> An Event is a user Interaction with the Browser.
                        -> We can Bind any number of Events to any Element in the DOM.
                        -> Same Event can be Binded to the Same Element Multiple times.
                        -> Events belong to a Specific Type.(e.g MouseEvent Type Consists of Click, dblclick etc..)
                        -> Each Event Type is a SEPARATE JavaScript OBJECT TYPE(i.e A Constructor is Defined for Each Event Type), having their own properties and Methods.
                        -> Each Event is an Object/Instance of a Particular Event Type.

Event handler/       -  -> Event handler is an object that implements the EventListener interface and provides an EventListener.handleEvent() callback method. Event handlers are language-specific.
Event listener          -> Event handlers are invoked in the context of a particular object (the current event target)(i.e the Event handler "this" value is set to E's currentTarget and
                           are provided with the event object itself(as Parameter).
                        -> They are invoked with one argument, the value of which is the Event object E.
                        -> When an Event Occurs on an Element and that Element has that Event Binded to it, then an Event handler(basically a JavaScript Function) is used/Called
                           to Handle that Event.

Standard events      -  -> These events are defined in official Web specifications, and should be common across browsers.
                        -> We can also find information about the event based on the Object sent with each Event Type.
