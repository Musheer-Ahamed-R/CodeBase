Notes :
   -> The jQuery function can take Document Object or CSS Selector.(e.g img etc..)
   -> Html Element Ids must be Unique on the Page.
   -> jQuery Id Selector returns only the FIRST Matching Element(rest if present are Ignored).
   -> To check if an Element Exists/Returned by the jQuery Selector, we should use the length property.
   -> A jQuery object wraps the Raw DOM Object and provides jQuery Methods.
   -> To get the underlying DOM Object from a jQuery object, we have to Index that with the Index Position.(i.e) $("#id")[0]
   -> Get(something) is done for the First Matched element and Set is Done for all the Matching Elements in most cases.
   -> According to the DOM specification, any string of text within an element is considered a child node(Text Node) of that element.
   -> $("input") will only return elements with the input tag, whereas $(":input") selects all input, select, textarea and button elements.
   -> Input elements can be Wrapped inside a Label Element to make the Input element to be Selected when we click on its associated Text Content.
      The for attribute of Label, should be given the ID of the associated input Element.
   -> The value Property doesn't reflect the value Attribute, Instead, it's the current value of the input. When the user manually changes
      the value of the input box, the value property will reflect this change. (i.e) The value Attribute is NOT CHANGED When the user changes
      the Value of an Element.(e.g Input Text Element)
