Notes :
   -> The jQuery function can take Document Object or CSS Selector.(e.g img etc..)
   -> Html Element Ids must be Unique on the Page.
   -> jQuery Id Selector returns only the FIRST Matching Element(rest if present are Ignored).
   -> To check if an Element Exists/Returned by the jQuery Selector, we should use the length property.
   -> A jQuery object wraps the Raw DOM Object and provides jQuery Methods.
   -> To get the underlying DOM Object from a jQuery object, we have to Index that with the Index Position.(i.e) $("#id")[0]
   -> Get(something) is done for the First Matched element and Set is Done for all the Matching Elements in most cases.
   -> According to the DOM specification, any string of text within an element is considered a child node(Text Node) of that element.
