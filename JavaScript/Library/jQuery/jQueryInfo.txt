jQuery   -  -> jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It makes things like HTML document traversal and manipulation,
               event handling, animation, and Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude of browsers.

Advantages of jQuery -  -> It is Cross-Browser.
                        -> It is easier to use than Native JavaScript.
                        -> It is Extensible.
                        -> Simplifies and has Rich AJAX Support.
                        -> It has Large Development Community and Many Plugins.

Notes :
      -> $ is a shortcut for jQuery Object.

CDN                  -  -> Content Delivery Network(CDN) is a System of Distributed Servers that host resources such as Images, CSS, JavaScript Files etc..
                        -> Benefits of Using CDN   -
                              -> Distributed CDN Servers -  -> The jQuery file can be Downloaded from the CDN Server that is Closest to the User.
                              -> Browser Caching         -  -> If a User visits a Web Page that loads jQuery from a CDN Server, the Browser automatically Caches the File,
                                                               Thus, if he visits our website, the jQuery file NEED NOT be download it again.
                              -> Parallel Downloads      -  -> Escapes Parallel Download Restriction on a Domain.
                              -> Reduced Server Load     -  -> No Page Load will make a jQuery File request to our Server.
                        -> Disadvantages                 -  -> Our Client/Users Firewall may block the CDN. So, we may have to request to Whitelist the CDN.
                        Notes :
                           -> In case of any Failure to load jQuery from the CDN, we have to gracefully switch back to loading jQuery from our Server itself.


Additional Notes
   -> function -  -> Receives the index position of the element in the set and the old value(that will be returned by the Outer Function(e.g html() etc..)) as arguments(index because set is done on all the Set Elements(i.e) Not the First one).
                  -> We can use the old value argument to reference the previous content.
                  -> Within the function, "this" refers to the current element in the set.
                  Declaration
                        Function( Integer index, htmlString oldhtml )

jQuery Functions     -
      -> .ready()    -  -> This method offers a way to run JavaScript code as soon as the page's Document Object Model (DOM) becomes SAFE to manipulate/the DOM is fully loaded.
                        -> This doesn't wait for Images, CSS, Frames to be Fully Loaded.
                        Syntax                                 Returns
                           $( document ).ready( handler )      jQuery
                           $( handler )      // Preferred      jQuery
                           $().ready( handler )                jQuery

      -> .load()     -  -> The load event is sent to an element when it and all sub-elements have been COMPLETELY loaded.
                        -> This event fires after the "ready" Event.
                        -> This event can be sent to any element associated with a URL: images, scripts, frames, iframes, and the window object.
                        -> In general, it is not necessary to wait for all images to be fully loaded. If code can be executed earlier, it is usually
                           best to place it in a handler sent to the .ready() method.
                        -> This is removed in Version 3.0.
                        Syntax                                 Returns     Notes

      -> .click()    -  -> Bind an event handler to the "click" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element.
                        Syntax                                 Returns     Notes

      -> .css()     -   -> Get the value of a computed style property for the FIRST element in the set of matched elements or set one or more CSS properties for every matched element.
                        -> This accepts RELATIVE values similar to .animate(). Relative values are a string starting with += or -= to increment or decrement the current value. based on its previous values.

                              .css( propertyNames )            String      propertyNames is an Array of one or more CSS properties.

                              .css( propertyName, function )   jQuery      A function returning the value to set.

      -> .html()    -   -> Get the HTML contents of the first element in the set of matched elements or set the HTML contents of every matched element.
                        -> This method uses the browser's innerHTML property.
                        -> Additionally, jQuery removes other constructs such as data and event handlers from child elements before replacing those elements with the new content.
                        -> In Internet Explorer up to and including version 9, setting the text content of an HTML element may corrupt the text nodes of its children that are being removed from the document
                           as a result of the operation. If we are keeping references to these DOM elements and need them to be unchanged, use .empty().html( string ) instead of .html(string)
                           so that the elements are removed from the document before the new string is assigned to the element.

      -> .each()    -   -> It iterates over the DOM elements that are part of the jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element.
                        -> Most jQuery methods that return a jQuery object also loop through the set of elements in the jQuery collection â€” a process known as implicit iteration.
                           When this occurs, it is often unnecessary to explicitly iterate with the .each() method:
                        -> We can stop the loop from within the callback function by returning false.

                        -> The .text() method cannot be used on form inputs or scripts. To set or get the text value of input or textarea elements, use the .val() method. To get the value of a script element, use the .html() method.
