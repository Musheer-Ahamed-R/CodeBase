jQuery   -  -> jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It makes things like HTML document traversal and manipulation,
               event handling, animation, and Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude of browsers.

Advantages of jQuery -  -> It is Cross-Browser.
                        -> It is easier to use than Native JavaScript.
                        -> It is Extensible.
                        -> Simplifies and has Rich AJAX Support.
                        -> It has Large Development Community and Many Plugins.

Notes :
      -> $ is a shortcut for jQuery Object.

CDN                  -  -> Content Delivery Network(CDN) is a System of Distributed Servers that host resources such as Images, CSS, JavaScript Files etc..
                        -> Benefits of Using CDN   -
                              -> Distributed CDN Servers -  -> The jQuery file can be Downloaded from the CDN Server that is Closest to the User.
                              -> Browser Caching         -  -> If a User visits a Web Page that loads jQuery from a CDN Server, the Browser automatically Caches the File,
                                                               Thus, if he visits our website, the jQuery file NEED NOT be download it again.
                              -> Parallel Downloads      -  -> Escapes Parallel Download Restriction on a Domain.
                              -> Reduced Server Load     -  -> No Page Load will make a jQuery File request to our Server.
                        -> Disadvantages                 -  -> Our Client/Users Firewall may block the CDN. So, we may have to request to Whitelist the CDN.
                        Notes :
                           -> In case of any Failure to load jQuery from the CDN, we have to gracefully switch back to loading jQuery from our Server itself.



jQuery Functions     -
      -> .ready()    -  -> This method offers a way to run JavaScript code as soon as the page's Document Object Model (DOM) becomes SAFE to manipulate/the DOM is fully loaded.
                        -> This doesn't wait for Images, CSS, Frames to be Fully Loaded.
                        Syntax                                 Returns
                           $( document ).ready( handler )      jQuery
                           $( handler )      // Preferred      jQuery
                           $().ready( handler )                jQuery

      -> .load()     -  -> The load event is sent to an element when it and all sub-elements have been COMPLETELY loaded.
                        -> This event fires after the "ready" Event.
                        -> This event can be sent to any element associated with a URL: images, scripts, frames, iframes, and the window object.
                        -> In general, it is not necessary to wait for all images to be fully loaded. If code can be executed earlier, it is usually
                           best to place it in a handler sent to the .ready() method.
                        -> This is removed in Version 3.0.
