jQuery   -  -> jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It makes things like HTML document traversal and manipulation,
               event handling, animation, and Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude of browsers.

Advantages of jQuery -  -> It is Cross-Browser.
                        -> It is easier to use than Native JavaScript.
                        -> It is Extensible.
                        -> Simplifies and has Rich AJAX Support.
                        -> It has Large Development Community and Many Plugins.

Notes :
      -> $ is a shortcut for jQuery Object.
      -> jQuery objects maintain an internal STACK that keeps track of changes to the matched set of elements. When one of the DOM traversal methods(e.g add, filter etc..) is called,
         the New SET of elements is pushed onto the stack. (i.e. jQuery Object contains a STACK OF SETS(MATCHED SETS of Elements).
         Thus, jQuery Chaining involves a Single jQuery Object with Current SET of Matched Elements on TOP of the STACK.

CDN                  -  -> Content Delivery Network(CDN) is a System of Distributed Servers that host resources such as Images, CSS, JavaScript Files etc..
                        -> Benefits of Using CDN   -
                              -> Distributed CDN Servers -  -> The jQuery file can be Downloaded from the CDN Server that is Closest to the User.
                              -> Browser Caching         -  -> If a User visits a Web Page that loads jQuery from a CDN Server, the Browser automatically Caches the File,
                                                               Thus, if he visits our website, the jQuery file NEED NOT be download it again.
                              -> Parallel Downloads      -  -> Escapes Parallel Download Restriction on a Domain.
                              -> Reduced Server Load     -  -> No Page Load will make a jQuery File request to our Server.
                        -> Disadvantages                 -  -> Our Client/Users Firewall may block the CDN. So, we may have to request to Whitelist the CDN.
                        Notes :
                           -> In case of any Failure to load jQuery from the CDN, we have to gracefully switch back to loading jQuery from our Server itself.

Additional Notes
   -> function -  -> Receives the index position of the element in the set and the old value(that will be returned by the Outer Function(e.g html() etc..)) / Elements as arguments(index because set is done on all the Set Elements(i.e) Not the First one).
                  -> We can use the old value argument to reference the previous content.
                  -> Within the function, "this" refers to the current element in the set.
                  Declaration
                        Function( Integer index, Element element )

jQuery Functions     -
      -> .ready()    -  -> This method offers a way to run JavaScript code as soon as the page's Document Object Model (DOM) becomes SAFE to manipulate/the DOM is fully loaded.
                        -> This doesn't wait for Images, CSS, Frames to be Fully Loaded.

      -> .load()     -  -> The load event is sent to an element when it and all sub-elements have been COMPLETELY loaded.
                        -> This event fires after the "ready" Event.
                        -> This event can be sent to any element associated with a URL: images, scripts, frames, iframes, and the window object.
                        -> In general, it is not necessary to wait for all images to be fully loaded. If code can be executed earlier, it is usually
                           best to place it in a handler sent to the .ready() method.
                        -> This is removed in Version 3.0.

                        Notes :
                           -> It is inadvisable to bind handlers to both the click and dblclick events for the same element. The sequence of events triggered
                              varies from browser to browser, with some receiving two click events before the dblclick and others only one.
                              Double-click sensitivity (maximum time between clicks that is detected as a double click) can vary by operating system and browser,
                              and is often user-configurable.

      -> .css()      -  -> Get the value of a computed style property for the FIRST element in the set of matched elements or set one or more CSS properties for every matched element.
                        -> This accepts RELATIVE values similar to .animate(). Relative values are a string starting with += or -= to increment or decrement the current value. based on its previous values.

                        -> In Internet Explorer up to and including version 9, setting the text content of an HTML element may corrupt the text nodes of its children that are being removed from the document
                           as a result of the operation. If we are keeping references to these DOM elements and need them to be unchanged, use .empty().html( string ) instead of .html(string)
                           so that the elements are removed from the document before the new string is assigned to the element.

                        -> The .prop() method provides a way to explicitly retrieve property values, while .attr() retrieves attributes.
                        -> The most important concept to remember about the checked attribute is that it does not correspond to the checked property. The attribute actually corresponds
                           to the defaultChecked property and should be used only to set the initial value of the checkbox. The checked attribute value does not change with the state of the checkbox,

                        -> Unlike other filtering methods, .is() does not create a new jQuery object. Instead, it allows you to test the contents of a jQuery object without modification.
                        -> This is often useful inside callbacks, such as event handlers.(i.e can be used to know if a Particular element(and NOT its Descendants) was clicked).

      -> .not()      -  -> Given a jQuery object that represents a set of DOM elements, the .not() method constructs a new jQuery object from a subset of the matching elements.
                        -> The supplied selector is tested against each element; the elements that don't match the selector will be included in the result.

                           -> When a CSS selector string is passed to .not(), text and comment nodes will always be removed from the resulting jQuery object during the filtering process.
                              When a specific node or array of nodes are provided, text or comment nodes will only be removed from the jQuery object if they match one of the nodes
                              in the filtering array.

      -> .end()      -  -> End the most recent filtering operation in the current chain and return the set of matched elements to its previous state.
                        -> Most of jQuery's DOM traversal methods operate on a jQuery object instance and produce a new one, matching a different set of DOM elements.
                           When this happens, it is as if the New SET of Elements is pushed onto a Stack that is maintained inside the object.
                           Each SUCCESSIVE FILTERING method pushes a New Element "SET" onto the stack.
                           If we need an older element set, we can use end() to pop the sets back off of the stack.
                        -> The end() method is useful primarily when exploiting jQuery's chaining properties.
                        -> A long jQuery chain can be visualized as a structured code block, with filtering methods providing the openings of nested blocks
                           and end() methods closing them.

                        -> As the return value is a jQuery object, which CONTAINS AN ARRAY, it's very common to call .get() on the result to work with a basic array.
                        -> The .map() method is particularly useful for getting or setting the value of a collection of elements.
                        -> The function/callback can return an individual data item or an array of data items(Data can be ANYTHING) to be inserted into the resulting set. If an array is returned,
                           the elements inside the array are inserted into the set. If the function returns null or undefined, no element will be inserted.
                        -> This method is different from .each() in the sense that, .each() is just like a for loop which iterates over the matched set of items(and does some operation using them),
                           whereas .map() is used to RETURN some VALUE(that will be part of the NEW jQuery Object) for every matched element in the set.

                           The jQuery library provides $.makeArray() for such conversions.

                           with an empty set and a length property of 0.
                        -> The Difference between .get() and .eq() is that, .get(0) returns the first DOM element matched by the selector,

                           construct a new jQuery object wrapped around the closest positioned ancestor.
                        -> An element is said to be positioned if it has a CSS position attribute of relative, absolute, or fixed.
                        -> This information is useful for calculating offsets for performing animations and placing objects on the page.

                        -> The change event is sent to an element when its value changes. This event is limited to <input> elements, <textarea> boxes and <select> elements.
                        -> For select boxes, checkboxes, and radio buttons, the event is fired immediately when the user makes a selection with the mouse, but for the other element types
                           the event is deferred until the element loses focus.
                        -> To trigger the event manually, apply .change() without arguments.
                        -> Changing the value of an input element using JavaScript, using .val() for example, won't fire the event.

      -> .height()   -  -> Get the current computed height for the first element in the set of matched elements or set the height of every matched element.
                        -> The difference between .css( "height" ) and .height() is that the latter returns a unit-less pixel value (for example, 400) while the former returns a value
                           with units intact (for example, 400px).
                        -> The .height() method is recommended when an element's height needs to be used in a mathematical calculation.
                        -> Height Property of an Element "NORMALLY" DOES NOT INCLUDE Padding or Border or Margin of that Element.
                        -> The .height() will always return the content height, regardless of the value of the CSS box-sizing property. To avoid this penalty,
                           use .css( "height" ) rather than .height(), in this case.

                        Notes :
                           -> The "box-sizing" property is used to tell the browser what the sizing properties (width and height) should include(like padding, border etc..).
                           -> Although style and script tags will report a value for .width() or height() when ABSOLUTELY positioned and given display:block,
                              it is STRONGLY DISCOURAGED to call those methods on these tags. In addition to being a bad practice, the results may also prove unreliable.
                           -> The number returned by dimensions-related APIs, including .height(), may be fractional in some cases. Code should not assume it is an integer.
                              Also, dimensions may be incorrect when the page is zoomed by the user; browsers do not expose an API to detect this condition.
                           -> The value reported by .height() is not guaranteed to be accurate when the element or its parent is hidden. To get an accurate value,
                              ensure the element is visible before using .height(). jQuery will attempt to temporarily show and then re-hide an element in order to measure its dimensions,
                              but this is unreliable and (even when accurate) can significantly impact page performance. This show-and-rehide measurement feature may be removed
                              in a future version of jQuery.

                        -> This method returns the height of the element, including top and bottom padding, in pixels.
                        -> This method is not applicable to window and document objects. For these, use .height() instead.
                        -> When the Inner Height is SET, it is ADJUSTED from the ACTUAL HEIGHT(i.e Padding is not changed).

                        -> The .width() will always return the content height, regardless of the value of the CSS box-sizing property. To avoid this penalty,

                        Notes :
                           -> By design, any jQuery constructor or method that accepts an HTML string — jQuery(), .append(), .after(), etc. — can potentially execute code.
                              This can occur by injection of script tags or use of HTML attributes that execute code (for example, <img onload="">). Do not use these methods
                              to insert strings obtained from untrusted sources such as URL query parameters, cookies, or form inputs. Doing so can introduce cross-site-scripting (XSS)
                              vulnerabilities. Remove or escape any user input before adding content to the document.

                           the content precedes the method, either as a selector expression or as markup created on the fly, and it is inserted into the target container.
                        -> If an element selected from the DOM and passed as an Argument, it will be MOVED(from its Current Location in the DOM) to the target(Irrespective of the Number of targets),
                           rather than cloned.
                        -> If an element selected from DOM is inserted into a single location elsewhere in the DOM, it will be MOVED as the target's First Child(not cloned) and a
                           NEW set consisting of the INSERTED ELEMENTS is returned.
                        -> If there is more than one target element, however, cloned copies of the inserted element will be created for each target after the first,
                           and that new set (the original element plus clones) is returned.

                        -> When positioning a new element on top of an existing one for global manipulation (in particular, for implementing drag-and-drop),
                           .offset() is more useful.
                        -> The .offset() setter method allows us to reposition an element. The element's position is specified relative to the document.
                           If the element's position style property is currently static, it will be SET to RELATIVE to allow for this repositioning.

                        Notes :
                           -> jQuery does not support getting the position coordinates of hidden elements or accounting for borders, margins,
                              or padding set on the body element.
                           -> The number returned by dimensions-related APIs, including .position(), may be fractional in some cases. Code should not assume it is an integer.
                           -> Also, dimensions may be incorrect when the page is zoomed by the user; browsers do not expose an API to detect this condition.
                           -> While it is possible to get the coordinates of elements with visibility:hidden set, display:none is excluded from the
                              rendering tree and thus has a position that is undefined.

      -> .position() -  -> Get the current coordinates of the first element in the set of matched elements, RELATIVE to the OFFSET PARENT.
                        -> Contrast this with .offset(), which retrieves the current position relative to the Document.
                        -> When positioning a new element near another one and within the same containing DOM element, .position() is the more useful.

      -> .clone()    -  -> The .clone() method performs a deep copy of the set of matched elements,(i.e) that it copies the matched elements as well as all of
                           their descendant elements and text nodes.
                        -> When used in conjunction with one of the insertion methods(e.g append, prepend), .clone() is a convenient way to duplicate elements on a page. Since,
                           the Elements will be Otherwise MOVED from their position to the target.
                        -> All element data (attached by the .data() method) is also copied to the new copy.
                        -> However, the Objects and Arrays within element DATA are not copied and will continue to be shared between the cloned element and the original element.
                           To deep copy all data, copy each one manually.

                        Notes :
                           -> For performance reasons, the dynamic state of certain form elements (e.g., user data typed into textarea and user selections made to a select) is
                              not copied to the cloned elements. When cloning input elements, the dynamic state of the element (e.g., user data typed into text inputs and
                              user selections made to a checkbox) is retained in the cloned elements.
                           -> When using the .clone() method, we can modify the cloned elements or their contents before (re-)inserting them into the document.
                           -> Using .clone() has the side-effect of producing elements with duplicate id attributes, which are supposed to be unique. Where possible,
                              it is recommended to avoid cloning elements with this attribute or using class attributes as identifiers instead.


      -> jQuery.cssNumber-> An object containing all CSS properties that may be used WITHOUT a unit. The .css() method uses this object to see if it may append px to unitless values.
                        -> The keys of the jQuery.cssNumber object are camel-cased and the values are all set to true
                        -> If we want to prevent the .css() method from automatically adding the px unit for a specific CSS property,
                           we can add an extra property to the jQuery.cssNumber object.
                        Syntax (e.g)
                           jQuery.cssNumber.someCSSProp = true;

      -> .blur()     -  -> Bind an event handler to the "blur" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element.
                        -> The blur event is sent to an element when it loses focus and an element can lose focus via keyboard commands, such as the Tab key,
                           or by mouse clicks elsewhere on the page.
