Notes : 















	-> If a property is unknown or if a value is not valid for a given property, the declaration is deemed invalid and is wholly ignored by the 
	   browser's CSS engine.

	-> In CSS (and other web standards), US spelling has been agreed on as the standard to stick to where uncertainty arises. For example, color (as seen 
	   in the above code) should always be spelt color. colour won't work.

	-> If a single basic selector in a chain or group is invalid, like when using an unknown pseudo-element or pseudo-class, the whole group of 
	   selectors is invalid and therefore the entire rule is invalid and ignored.   

	-> The whitespace we need to be careful of in CSS is the whitespace around the properties and their values. i.e padding- left is Invalid.

**
	-> Properties override other properties, but you don't get entire rules overriding other rules. When several CSS rules match the same element, they
	   are ALL applied to that element. Only after that are any conflicting properties evaluated to see which individual styles will win over others.
